					The Boomba, coming out in 2077, will be the next best thing in home security. It's ability to stomp out any home intruders and unwanted guests is unmatched. Theorized about in 2019, the Boomba from the beginning was about personal saftey and giving power to the consumer.

<!-- Customer review: Jane Fihlo
    My name is Jane Fihlo and I knew that as soon as I sat my eyes upon the Boomba that I needed it. I'm a single mother of three, ages nine, seven, and six, and I've always worried that if someone was to break into my home, I might not be able to protect my babies. However, as soon as I saw the Boomba and its protective capabilities, I felt a sense of awe wash over me. I didn't get the product immediately, for I needed time to process if I could afford the Boomba. I came to my sense however, and realized that the saftey of my children is worth any cost. The rest is history! I've been satisfied with the product for almost 6 months now, and I can now go to bed, reasurred that my children will grow up not having to worry about harm coming to our household.

<!-- Cusomer review: Ted Kinder
	My name is Ted Kinder, and I've been working ever since I was six. My father owned a plot of land west of the Mississippi, about 1000 acres, and I loved that piece of land. Eventually when my father passed away, I inherited his land and oversaw all of the land he and I once worked. I learned to appreciate the soil and I understood my place in the universe. That all changed however when I had my home broken into and my fields set on fire. It happened almost 2 years ago and I still think about it everyday. Since then I've moved to Jefferson City and liquidated most of my assests I had on my farm. I've always been afraid that I would have the same fate that happened to my farm, happen to my town house in Jefferson City. That changed however,all because of a friendly robot named Boomba. Ever since I've gotten my Boomba, I've been able to sleep with no terrible nightmares and waking fears.

<!-- New York Times review: Erin Griffith
	"The best and most revolutionary start-up in the Mid-West."

	The new start-up from Indianapolis is looking promising for those who are interested in tech and security. The Boomba hopes to close the gap between home security and AI. The project, created from a team of 5 young men, has taken Wall Street buy storm, with their promises of high dividends and low risks. The team seems to be taking the new founded fame to new founded hights in order to deliver thier goal by 2077.
